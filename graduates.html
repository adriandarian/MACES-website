<h3>MACES Graduate Training</h3>

<p>The MACES Graduate Training program supports talented graduate students tackling exciting challenges in nanomaterials, especially those connected to NASA missions, in a dynamic, supportive, and multidisciplinary environment.</p>

<h4>Our training program includes:</h4>

<ul>
  <li class="graduates-content">
    <b>Interdisciplinary Coursework:</b>
    The MACES students participate in the nanotechnology emphasis tracks within the <a href="http://physics.ucmerced.edu/">physics</a>, <a href="http://chemistry.ucmerced.edu/">chemistry</a>, <a href="http://me.ucmerced.edu/">Mechanical Engineering</a>, and <a href="http://best.ucmerced.edu/">biological engineering and small-scale technologies (BEST)</a> graduate groups. Our tailored curriculum provides in-depth training in the home discipline as well as sustained exposure to other relevant fields, facilitating the cross-fertilization of ideas and collaborations.
  </li>
  <li class="graduates-content">
    <b>Multidisciplinary and collaborative research training:</b>
    MACES students address important challenges in nanomaterials for NASA missions, which require innovative and multidisciplinary solutions. MACES students interact and collaborate with other scientists and engineers who share a common interest in functional nanomaterials but have complementary expertise. All MACES fellows participate in one of the MACES Research Thrusts (<a href="http://maces.ucmerced.edu/energy-thrust/">Energy</a> or <a href="http://maces.ucmerced.edu/sensing-thrust/">Sensing</a>), which meet monthly to promote collaboration.
  </li>
  <li class="graduates-content">
    <b>Mentoring and professional development:</b>
    MACES students benefit from comprehensive mentoring by <a href="http://maces.ucmerced.edu/faculty/">faculty</a> who are top experts in their fields. Our peer mentoring program pairs new graduate students with senior students who help them navigate the challenges of graduate school. MACES hosts workshops that help students improve their professional skills and specific research skills.
  </li>
  <li class="graduates-content">
    <b>Outreach:</b>
    MACES students are involved in <a href="http://maces.ucmerced.edu/community-outreach/k-12-nanotechnology-modules/">outreach activities</a> that enhance the publicâ€™s interest in and understanding of STEM. These activities also help our students hone their communication skills.
  </li>
  <li class="graduates-content">
    <b>State-of-the-art equipment and facilities:</b>
    MACES students have access to cutting-edge equipment and facilities at UC Merced and nearby National Labs.
  </li>
  <li class="graduates-content">
    <b>NASA internships:</b>
     MACES graduate students who are citizens of the USA are eligible to apply to our <a href="http://maces.ucmerced.edu/nasa-internships/">NASA internship program</a>.
