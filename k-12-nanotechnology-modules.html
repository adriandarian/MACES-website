<p>Today, the excitement of science is often diluted by the way it is taught in elementary, middle, and high school: covering a wide range of disjointed topics without depth, and disconnecting scientific content from scientific practices (knowing versus doing).</p>

<p>
  To support high-school science teachers seamlessly link tangible technological solutions with STEM concepts, MACES offers a paid Teacher Professional Development Workshop every summer. A key element of the workshop is the development of discovery-based modules on <a href="http://maces.ucmerced.edu/energy-thrust/">Energy</a> and <a href="http://maces.ucmerced.edu/sensing-thrust/">Sensing</a>. These modules integrate cutting-edge technologies with scientific processes to reinforce basic STEM concepts and to stimulate interest in STEM.

<p>
  Every year, 4-6 high-school science teachers participate in summer professional development and co-develop discovery-based modules with <a href="http://maces.ucmerced.edu/graduates/">MACES graduate students</a>. Importantly, these relationships extend beyond the workshopâ€”we help teachers to implement these modules in their home schools and collect feedback for continuous improvement.
